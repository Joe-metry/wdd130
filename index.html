        <p>Hello, my name is Ubi, Joseph from Nigeria in West Africa. I recently completed
            BYU-Pathway, after
            which I immediately enrolled in the
            Software Development degree program. I am deeply passionate about software development,
            with a
            growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data. I enjoy sports, staying active in
            fitness, and
            I value my faith, Church involvement, and family very highly. I also have a strong love
            for science
            and continuous learning, and I enjoy challenging myself with new ideas and technologies
            that help me
            grow both personally and professionally.</p>

        <p>Nigeria is a land of striking contrasts, from the humid coastal south shaped by rivers
            and the
            Atlantic Ocean to the rolling hills of Enugu’s Milliken Hills. The Middle Belt rises
            into mountains,
            while diverse cultures, languages, music, and traditions give the nation a vibrant,
            diverse identity
            and an enduring history.</p>
