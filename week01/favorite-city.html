    <h1>About My favorite City.</h1>
    <p>Port Harcourt is my favorite city, where the sky often opens and the rain feels like a gentle
        blessing.
        I love how the rain cools the streets and gives the city a calm, reflective mood.
        The ocean nearby breathes life into the air, carrying the scent of salt and adventure.
        Waves tell stories of journeys, trade, and the deep history of the coast.
        The people of Port Harcourt are warm, resilient, and full of vibrant energy.
        Their laughter and conversations flow as naturally as the rivers that meet the sea.
        Coastal life here moves with its own rhythm, shaped by tides and traditions.
        Even on the busiest days, the ocean reminds me to slow down and breathe.
        Rainy evenings glow with streetlights reflecting on wet roads and hopeful faces.
        In Port Harcourt, the rain, the ocean, and the people feel like home.</p>
