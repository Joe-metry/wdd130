        <p>Hello, my name is Ubi, Joseph from Nigeria in West Africa. I recently completed
            BYU-Pathway, after
            which I immediately enrolled in the
            Software Development degree program. I am deeply passionate about software development,
            with a
            growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data. I enjoy sports, staying active in
            fitness, and
            I value my faith, Church involvement, and family very highly. I also have a strong love
            for science
            and continuous learning, and I enjoy challenging myself with new ideas and technologies
            that help me
            grow both personally and professionally.</p>
